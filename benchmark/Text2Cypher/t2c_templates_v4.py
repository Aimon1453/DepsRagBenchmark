"""Template registry for the merged v4 Text2Cypher bank.

v4 exists because the two parallel template designs were merged. The bank is now
keyed on **Lu Xu's sheet numbering** (Google Sheet "Template", 54 rows), because
that sheet is the one both authors design into. The v3 IDs are kept in `v3_id` so
per-template scores from the four finished v3 campaigns can still be joined to
the new bank: the IDs collide semantically across the two designs (v3 `C1.2` asks
about vulnerabilities, sheet `C1.2` asks about existence), so *nothing* may be
compared by ID alone.

What v4 adds on top of a straight copy of the sheet:

1. **Strata.** The sheet has no notion of an answer stratum, so a template taken
   from it straight would have no empty-answer, no false-answer, and no
   absent-entity cases. A bank where every question has a non-empty answer never
   punishes a system that always answers something.
2. **A declared answer shape.** Each template states the columns it returns and
   whether row order is part of the answer. This is what makes a template
   *scoreable* rather than merely hard, and it is checked at build time.
3. **Stratum expectations.** A stratum declares what its cases must produce
   (`exists = false`, empty list, ...). If enumeration drifts, the build fails
   instead of quietly shipping mislabelled cases.

Adding the remaining templates means adding entries here; the builder needs no
change.
